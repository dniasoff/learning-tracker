# Firestore cutover — recovery log

**Purpose: agent recovery.** Sessions die mid-work — session limits, interrupts,
crashes. This file is what a fresh agent reads to resume without re-deriving
anything or redoing finished work.

**READ THIS FIRST**, before the plan, before the code, before any grep.

Companions: [`firestore-cutover-plan.md`](firestore-cutover-plan.md) (the
phases and the anti-slop protocol) · [`firestore-cutover-tasks.md`](firestore-cutover-tasks.md)
(open work items).

## Recovery protocol

Run these in order. Do not skip to the code.

1. **Read the CURRENT STATE block below.** It names the head commit, the phase
   in flight, and anything left half-done.
2. **Verify the tree**, because the log may predate a crash:
   ```
   cd /home/daniel/repos/learning-tracker
   git log --oneline -1
   git rev-list --left-right --count origin/dev...dev   # 0 0 = in sync
   git status --porcelain | grep -v '^ M _bmad'         # _bmad churn is pre-existing
   git stash list                                       # a stash here is a RED FLAG
   ```
3. **Check for orphaned work** if a session died: `pgrep -af "flutter[ ]test"`.
   This machine has held test processes orphaned for 4+ days; they burn CPU and
   skew any timing you observe.
4. **Confirm the gates** before trusting anything:
   ```
   cd learning_tracker
   dart analyze --fatal-infos                       # seconds
   dart run tool/check_profile_path_keying.dart     # ~1s — the keying gate
   ```
5. **Only then** read the plan and the task list.

### If a session died mid-build

- Uncommitted work in the tree is **suspect until verified**, not lost. Check
  whether the last agent finished: read its section under IN FLIGHT below.
- **Never `git stash`** to clean up. A partial pop has already silently dropped
  work on this project. Edit by hand.
- A gate result collected while agents were writing describes nothing. Wait for
  a write-quiet window first.

## CURRENT STATE

**Head:** `a2a21d0a` on `dev`, in sync with origin.
**Phase:** 0 ✅ · 1 ✅ · **2 not started**.
**Gates:** `make audit` green (103 checks). Full `make ci` last green at
`5b4d7924`; batched to end of Phase 4 by owner decision (2026-08-06).

**IN FLIGHT:** nothing. Tree is clean apart from pre-existing `_bmad/` config
churn that predates this work.

**Live on Firestore (4):** bookmarks · learning-order · profile identity ·
scheduler learning-order read.
**Dead adapters (7):** completion · curriculum-track · goal · progress ·
stage-definition · study-day-config · track-learning-order.

## Standing facts an agent must not re-derive

- **The migration unit is the int→ULID cut, not the feature.** The old sync
  engine writes `learner_profiles/{int}/…` for 14 collections; every Firestore
  repository reads `learner_profiles/{ULID}/…`. Disjoint trees. A feature moved
  alone reads a tree nothing writes.
- **The test suite cannot see this class of defect.** `fake_cloud_firestore`'s
  rules companion cannot evaluate `request.resource`, and tests seed whatever
  path the test itself chose. 144 tests passed over a branch that could not
  execute in production. Audit check 103 exists to close this.
- **`make audit` is a subset of `make ci`.** Checks exist in only one lane.
  `make audit`'s R6d coverage check *soft-skips* when `coverage/lcov.info` is
  absent and still exits 0 — read the lines above an exit code, not just the
  code.
- **Doc comments here are load-bearing and go stale.** A stale comment caused
  the deletion of a live feature. Verify a claim against code before acting.

## Entries

Newest first. Append; never rewrite history.

### 2026-08-06 — Phase 1 complete (`a2a21d0a`)

Built audit check 103 (`tool/check_profile_path_keying.dart`) + baseline +
`test/helpers/writer_reader_agreement.dart`. Baseline is exactly `bookmarks`
and `learning_order`. Wired into both `make audit` and `make ci`.

Adversarial verification found five defects, all fixed with reproductions:
gate never scanned `lib/features/**/data/repositories/` (where the adapters
live); reachability recognised one naming convention only, while the watchlist
promised otherwise; class regex missed Dart 3 modifiers (70 files use them);
unreadable files now ABORT loudly rather than reclassify; **reachability
counted doc comments and string literals as evidence — both baseline entries
were classified live off a doc comment, right by luck.**

Deviation: the gate ships **green**, not red as planned — both live splits are
baselined, which is the same information as "0 new violations". Burn-down
property unchanged.

Late defect caught by `make audit` at the phase boundary: the new helper test
declared a second `main()` under the libraries-only `test/helpers/`. Moved to
`test/writer_reader_agreement_helper_test.dart`. Invisible to analyze and to
the keying gate — the reason `make audit` stays per-phase.

### 2026-08-04 — Phase 0 decisions (`9a5cb97c`)

D1 tutor identity → re-file under ULID (value migration, not redesign: the
rules formula and `acceptInvite` already agree; only what `profileId` *is*
changes). D2 overdue backlog → restore both forgiveness paths; **cost was
under-stated to the owner** — the content-reseed half needs a new mechanism.
D3 learning-order reset → narrow client-delete allowance, `goals` precedent.

### 2026-08-04 — Cutover plan written (`70f23979`)

Five phases, gates first.

### 2026-08-03 — Bookmarks vertical slice (`5b4d7924`)

Took the smallest feature with real UI consumers end-to-end to convert an
estimate into a measurement. 71 files, +2354/−915.

**Result: feature-by-feature migration is impossible here.** Flipping bookmarks
stranded track-creation, learning-order and tutoring; fixing the learning-order
writer then stranded the scheduler's reader. Six regressions in four untouched
features. Every one passed the test suite.

Also found: the tutor read path documented in `firestore-rewrite-map.md` is
**rules-denied as written**; three owner-path Cloud Functions would silently
delete nothing post-cutover; `make ci` had been red on `dev` since the B2 wave
(a Rule 5 violation `make audit` cannot see, plus two re-export shims with no
lcov entry).

**Recovery events this session** (both survived without loss because work was
committed promptly): a workflow hit the session limit with 9/16 agents done,
leaving the tree built but entirely unverified; and a user interrupt stopped 48
agents mid-flight. Commit early — that is what made both recoverable.

## Convention for agent briefs

Every agent brief for this migration MUST require the agent to:

1. **Read this file first** and follow the recovery protocol.
2. **Report** — not silently absorb — anything contradicting the standing facts
   above.
3. Never `git stash`, never branch, never worktree, never commit or push.

The **coordinator** appends an entry here when a phase lands, when a session
dies mid-work (recording exactly what was in flight), and when a finding
changes the plan. Entries are append-only.
